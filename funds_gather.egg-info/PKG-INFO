        FundsGather is a script to gather your financial fund information from accounts that do not support standard banking file exports such as QFX, OFX, QIF or even direct connect.
        Currently, this program supports downloading transactions from Maryland's 529 College Savings plans and exporting to QIF, for import into your financial software like Quicken,
        Banktivity, or MoneyDance.  An OFX/QFX plugin is also in the works.

        Features
        ########
        
        
        * Import from web account of Maryland 529 College Savings of all accounts tied to user.
        * Export to QIF file.
        
        Right now, the functionality is fairly rudimentary, but I intend to develop this more in the months to come.  Here's my todo list:
        
        * Export to QFX/OFX (depending on what my financial software supports, it would be easier to write a plugin for XML compliant format)
        * Import other types of transactions (right now, only buys are supported)
        * Import other web sites
